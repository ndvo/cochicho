    <p>Three passwords?!? Yup. Much easier than special chars. Choose three
    passwords that will keep your secret messages secret.</p>
    <p>To make your password safe, at least one of them should have <strong>a character that is not a letter</strong>. Do not use only numbers.</p>

       <ul>
         <li>Use the TAB key to quickly mode between password fields.<span class="example">This can actually be only two keystrokes longer than your usual password: "my&lt;TAB&gt;usual&lt;TAB&gt;password"</span></li>
         <li>A password needs to be strong and that means lots of characters from a large character set. <span class="example">This is why most websites require you to use a long password with letters, capital letters, digits and symbols.</span></li>
         <li>A password needs to be known by heart. <span class="example">A password is something you know, and only you know. It shouldn't be written down, shouldn't be shared, shouldn't be forgotten.</span></li>
         <li>Strong passwords are usually hard to know by heart, and vice versa.<span class="example">The password "*ma√ß&WYap)0*=_ 7" is strong, but hard to memorize. The password "Jetsons" is easy to memorize, but weak.</span></li>
         <li>Three simple passwords are easier to memorize and harder to crack.<span class="example">Let's say you choose the passwords: "Mom" "Lives" "15th Av." That's easy enough to remember and it makes up to a 16 digit password with symbols, lower and upper case letters and numbers, the same as before.</span></li>
         <li>You can make it even stronger by not using only dictionary words. <span class="example">You may use one of the passwords for a weird symbol like | or ¬™¬™, or to use a word from a different language.</span></li>
